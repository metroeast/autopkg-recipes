Having ridden on the shoulders of so many.

We eventually found at least one app we want to manage with Autopkg, that no one else was managing.
I found a similarly distributed application whose recipe was created by Recipe Robot, and edited where needed.

This is also a home to JDCImporter based Jamf policy and patch management processor recipes.

We hope our work is useful to someone else with similiar needs.  More details soon.
